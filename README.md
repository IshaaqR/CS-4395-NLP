## Homework 1

* **What the program does:** The program reads in a file of employee information, processes the text to be more standardized, creates an object for each person with corrections from the user, and outputs each personâ€™s information at the end.
* **How to run it:** After downloading the folder for Homework 1 and changing your command line directory to that folder, type in: python "Homework1_imr180000.py" "data/data.csv".
* **Strengths/weaknesses of Python for text processing:** Python offers many libraries and built-in functions that help with text processing, which is a big advantage it has over other languages. However, since it is such a high-level programming language, it can be significantly slower.
* **What I learned:** While basic text processing functions like split() and capitalize() not new to me, I did experience using regex for the first time myself.

## Chatbot Project
The link to use the chatbot is [here](https://bot.dialogflow.com/5357b396-58af-4d2d-9fb9-56c4f0020e9f). Say hello to the bot, and it'll tell you what you can do with it.

Additionally, the code for the project is [here](https://github.com/IshaaqR/CS-4395-NLP/blob/419738977562595837de02ed786d89c1a98341f9/Chatbot%20Project/DemonSlayerBot.zip). It is in the form of a zip file that must be uploaded to Google Dialogflow in order to view. If you want a basic description of how the chatbot works you can check out the [report](https://github.com/IshaaqR/CS-4395-NLP/blob/419738977562595837de02ed786d89c1a98341f9/Chatbot%20Project/Report.pdf) or the knowledge base (which is located in the "Chatbot Project" folder.
