* The program reads in a file of employee information, processes the text to be more standardized, creates an object for each person with corrections from the user, and outputs each personâ€™s information at the end.
* After downloading the folder for Homework 1 and changing your command line directory to that folder, type in: python "Homework1_imr180000.py" "data/data.csv".
* Python offers many libraries and built-in functions that help with text processing, which is a big advantage it has over other languages. However, since it is such a high-level programming language, it can be significantly slower.
* While basic text processing functions like split() and capitalize() not new to me, I did experience using regex for the first time myself.
